# Leticia

A friendly ~~domestic~~ internet helper.

# Description

A pluggable node.js loop that monitors various internet services and delivers
notifications when they change. Inspired by
[Huginn](https://github.com/cantino/huginn) and the like.

**WARNING:** I've only just started this. It probably doesn't work properly.

# Running

You'll need to `cp config/default.yaml.example config/default.yaml` and fill in the API keys for the various services. Then just run `coffee leticia.coffee`.

# Why 'Leticia'?
